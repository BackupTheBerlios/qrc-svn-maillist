-- gay.com buddy list integration. An option to &quot;auto-add&quot; NOTIFY

-  without waiting for NOTIFY).
-
-- Synchronize buddy list with server.  This is easy to do.  Already, we
-  have the server's view of the list in config.txt.  Adding a new buddy
-  to the server is basically an http GET.  Some thought however needs to
-  be given to user interface design, in terms of whether we should sync
-  to the server's buddies, and/or bookmarks, and/or hotlist.
-
 - Bio Line display in chat window. (I think this can be done using
   TOPIC when the user's name is clicked.  I think yahoo may do something
   so its not editable, which would help us here.  So this could be a
   PROTOCOL PLUGIN)
 
-- The &quot;Room List&quot; operation should parse the /messenger/config.txt file
-  from gay.com. We need to hide as much as possible the &quot;real&quot; channel
-  names (Like #557 is Sacramento). As the room list is generated, it
-  should automatically display the multiple rooms associated with a
-  locale, so that the user can select one. The user should have the
-  option of adding EITHER the #xxx=* room, OR a particular #xxx=x room,
-  to the buddy list.   (I think this is somewhat done, but not sure)

 - Need a better way to coordinate VERSION between configure.ac an win32
   builds (which do not currently use autoconf).  Perhaps win32 can
   eventually use autoconf/automake, but I don't yet know how
   cross-compiler builds would work with this.
